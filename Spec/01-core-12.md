# BrainOps Language (BOL)
## Core-12 Specification (Normative)

This document defines the **minimal, irreducible core** of BrainOps Language (BOL).

Any implementation, document, or process claiming BOL compliance
**MUST fully conform** to all twelve core elements defined below.

Keywords **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **SHOULD**, **MAY** are normative.

---

## Core-12 Elements

### 1. Task
A formalized objective with verifiable completion.

Task {
  id
  goal
  class
}

Rule:
A Task without an explicit TaskClass is invalid.

---

### 2. TaskClass
Risk-based task typing.

TaskClass ::= A | B | C

- A: low risk, no mandatory human check
- B: medium risk, conditional human check
- C: high stakes, mandatory human check

Rule:
TaskClass determines verification depth and human involvement.

---

### 3. Context
The only admissible container of knowledge.

Context {
  known
  unknown
  assumptions
}

Rule:
Anything outside Context is treated as unknown.

---

### 4. CognitiveUnit
Minimal unit of formalized thinking.

CognitiveUnit ::= Task | Hypothesis | Check | Decision

Rule:
Decision MUST NOT exist without Check.

---

### 5. Hypothesis
A testable assumption derived from Context.

Rule:
Hypothesis MUST be verifiable or explicitly rejected.

---

### 6. Check
A verification procedure.

Check {
  target
  artifacts
  status
}

status ::= pass | fail | blocked

Rule:
A Check without Artifacts is incomplete.

---

### 7. Artifact
A verifiable proof of reasoning.

Artifact {
  type
  source
  validates
}

Rule:
Without required Artifacts, reasoning is invalid.

---

### 8. Invariant
A non-negotiable rule.

Invariant {
  id
  description
}

Rule:
Invariant violation blocks Decision regardless of progress.

---

### 9. Constraint
A limitation on allowed actions.

Constraint {
  scope
  forbidden
  allowed
}

Rule:
Forbidden always overrides Allowed.

---

### 10. Risk
Cognitive risk assessment.

Risk {
  level
  reason
  mitigation
}

level ::= low | medium | high | critical

Rule:
Risk is mandatory for TaskClass B and C.

---

### 11. Gate
A forced stopping point.

Gate {
  condition
  required_artifacts
  human_required
}

Rule:
Unmet Gate blocks phase transition.

---

### 12. Decision
A finalized outcome of thinking.

Decision {
  based_on
  artifacts
  owner
  timestamp
}

Rule:
Decision without owner or artifacts is invalid.

---

## Execution Rules (Summary)

- Thinking proceeds through enforced phases.
- Phases MUST NOT be skipped.
- Decisions occur only after verification.
- Failures are explicit and auditable.

---

## Core Rule of BrainOps

If a thought cannot be:
- fixed
- verified
- challenged

it MUST NOT influence a Decision.

---

## Compliance Statement

Any system, process, or document that:
- omits any Core-12 element
- weakens any Core-12 rule
- allows unverified Decisions

is **not BrainOps Language compliant**.
